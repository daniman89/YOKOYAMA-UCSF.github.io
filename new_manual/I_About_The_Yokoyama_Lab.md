# I. About The Yokoyama Lab

Welcome! We’re glad you’ve joined us and that our work, and the values that guide it, resonate with you. We hope that your time with us will be an enjoyable one of professional growth, new skill development, and fun.

We hope you’ll learn a lot about genetics and neuroscience, develop new skills (coding, data analysis, writing, giving talks), make new friends, and have a great deal of fun throughout the whole process.

## A. Lab Introduction

The Yokoyama Lab, or "Laboyama," focuses on understanding the genetic foundations of neurodegeneration, with a special emphasis on Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia. 

Our lab aims to uncover how genomic variations affect brain function and structure, with the ultimate goal of identifying therapeutic interventions. 

Laboyama fosters a culture of diversity, education, innovation, and a people-first approach, reflecting our commitment to inclusivity, discovery, and developing future leaders in brain health research. Led by Dr. Jennifer Yokoyama, the lab combines innovative genomics, neuroimaging, and transcriptomics research to push the boundaries of neurodegenerative disease understanding.
